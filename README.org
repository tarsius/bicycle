** Cycle outline and code visibility

This package provides commands for cycling the visibility of
outline sections and code blocks.  These commands are intended to
be bound in ~outline-minor-mode-map~ and do most of the work using
functions provided by the ~outline~ package.

This package is named ~bicycle~ because it can additionally make
use of the ~hideshow~ package.

If ~hs-minor-mode~ is enabled and point is at the start of a code
block, then ~hs-toggle-hiding~ is used instead of some ~outline~
function.  When you later cycle the visibility of a section that
contains code blocks (which is done using ~outline~ functions),
then code block that have been hidden using ~hs-toggle-hiding~,
are *not* extended.

A reasonable configuration could be:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package bicycle
    :after outline
    :bind (:map outline-minor-mode-map
                ([C-tab] . bicycle-cycle)
                ([S-tab] . bicycle-cycle-global)))

  (use-package prog-mode
    :config
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'outline-minor-mode)
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'hs-minor-mode))
